                        <p>While common definitions of loneliness describe it as a state of solitude or being alone, loneliness is actually a state of mind. Loneliness causes people to feel empty, alone, and unwanted. People who are lonely often crave human contact, but their state of mind makes it more difficult to form connections with others.</p>
                        <p>Growing concerns around the dangers of loneliness have prompted a call to action by US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who recently issued an 82-page advisory on the issue. The advisory cites data from several studies, including research that found that nearly half of adults in the US experience feelings of loneliness daily.</p>
                        <p>Murthy's report also cites a meta-analysis that found that the risk of premature death due to loneliness increased by 26% and 29% due to social isolation. Furthermore, the lack of social connection can increase the risk of anxiety, depression, stroke, heart disease, and dementia.</p>
                        <p>This article discusses what we mean by the term "lonely," as well as the various causes, health consequences, symptoms, and potential treatments for loneliness.</p>

                        <p className="lonely-blog-list">While research clearly shows that loneliness and isolation are bad for both mental and physical health, being alone is not the same as being lonely. In fact, solitude actually has a number of important mental health benefits, including allowing people to better focus and recharge.
                            <ul>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Loneliness is marked by feelings of isolation despite wanting social connections. It is often perceived as an involuntary separation, rejection, or abandonment by other people.</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Solitude, on the other hand, is voluntary. People who enjoy spending time by themselves continue to maintain positive social relationships that they can return to when they crave connection. They still spend time with others, but these interactions are balanced with periods of time alone.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p className="lonely-blog-list">Loneliness is a state of mind linked to wanting human contact but feeling alone. People can be alone and not feel lonely, or they can have contact with people and still experience feelings of isolation.</p>

                        <b className="lonely-blog-list">Causes of Loneliness</b>
                        <p className="lonely-blog-list">Contributing factors to loneliness include situational variables, such as physical isolation, moving to a new location, and divorce. The death of someone significant in a person's life can also lead to feelings of loneliness.</p>
                        <p className="lonely-blog-list">Additionally, it can be a symptom of a psychological disorder such as depression. Depression often causes people to withdrawal socially, which can lead to isolation. Research also suggests that loneliness can be a factor that contributes to symptoms of depression.</p>
                        <p className="lonely-blog-list">Loneliness can also be attributed to internal factors such as low self-esteem. People who lack confidence in themselves often believe that they are unworthy of the attention or regard of other people, which can lead to isolation and chronic loneliness.</p>
                        <p className="lonely-blog-list">Personality factors may also play a role. Introverts, for example, might be less likely to cultivate and seek social connections, which can contribute to feelings of isolation and loneliness.</p>

                        <b className="lonely-blog-list">Health Risks Associated With Loneliness</b>
                        <p className="lonely-blog-list">Loneliness has a wide range of negative effects on both physical and mental health, including:
                            <ul>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Alcohol and drug misuse</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Altered brain function</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Alzheimer's disease progression</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Antisocial behavior</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Cardiovascular disease and stroke</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Decreased memory and learning</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Depression and suicide</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Increased stress levels</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Poor decision-making</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p className="lonely-blog-list">These are not the only areas in which loneliness takes its toll. For example, lonely adults get less exercise than those who are not lonely. Their diet is higher in fat, their sleep is less efficient, and they report more daytime fatigue. Loneliness also disrupts the regulation of cellular processes deep within the body, predisposing lonely people to premature aging.</p>

                        <b className="lonely-blog-list">What Research Suggests About Loneliness</b>
                        <p className="lonely-blog-list">People who feel less lonely are more likely to be married, have higher incomes, and have higher educational status. High levels of loneliness are associated with physical health symptoms, living alone, small social networks, and low-quality social relationships.</p>
                        <p className="lonely-blog-list"><i>Close Friends Help Combat Loneliness</i></p>
                        <p className="lonely-blog-list">Statistics suggest that loneliness is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly in younger generations. According to one 2019 survey, 25% of adults between the ages of 18 and 27 reported having no close friends, while 22% reported having no friends at all.</p>
                        <p className="lonely-blog-list">The rise of the internet and ironically, social media, are partially to blame.</p>
                        <p className="lonely-blog-list">Experts believe that it is not the quantity of social interaction that combats loneliness, but the quality.</p>
                        <p className="lonely-blog-list">Having a few close friends is enough to ward off loneliness and reduce the negative health consequences associated with this state of mind. Research suggests that the experience of actual face-to-face contact with friends helps boost people's sense of well-being.</p>
                        <p className="lonely-blog-list"><i>Loneliness Can Be Contagious</i></p>
                        <p className="lonely-blog-list">One study suggests that loneliness may actually be contagious. Research has found that non-lonely people who spend time with lonely people are more likely to develop feelings of loneliness.</p>

                        <p className="lonely-blog-list">Here are some ways to prevent loneliness:
                            <ul>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Consider community service or another activity that you enjoy. These situations present great opportunities to meet people and cultivate new friendships and social interactions.</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Expect the best. Lonely people often expect rejection, so instead, try focusing on positive thoughts and attitudes in your social relationships.</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Focus on developing quality relationships. Seek people who share similar attitudes, interests, and values with you.</li>

Don't expect things to change overnight, but you can start taking steps that will help relieve your feelings of loneliness and build connections that support your well-being.</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Understand the effects of loneliness on your life. There are physical and mental repercussions to loneliness. If you recognize some of these symptoms affecting how you feel, make a conscious effort to combat them.</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Join a group or start your own.

You might also consider taking a class at a community college, joining a book club, or taking an exercise class.</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Strengthen a current relationship. Building new connections is important, but improving your existing relationships can also be a great way to combat loneliness. Try calling a friend or family member you have spoken to in a while.</li>
                                <li className="lonely-blog-list">Talk to someone you can trust. Reaching out to someone in your life to talk about what you are feeling is important. This can be someone you know such as a family member, but you might also consider talking to your doctor or a therapist. Online therapy can be a great option because it allows you to contact a therapist whenever it is convenient for you.</li>
                            </ul>
