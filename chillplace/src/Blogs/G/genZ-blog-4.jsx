                        <p className="sub-blog-list">Although research is still ongoing on the pros and cons of video games, some studies thus far have shown the following benefits when an individual plays video games:
                            <ul>
                                <li className="sub-blog-list">Improved cognitive functions</li>
                                <li className="sub-blog-list">Problem-solving skills and the use of logic</li>
                                <li className="sub-blog-list">Hand-to-eye coordination</li>

                        <p className="sub-blog-list">These pros of video games might help you with tasks that you do every day, but they might also be applicable for jobs where you require a great deal of attention and concentration, such as working as a surgeon, driver, or programmer.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">On the surface, these pros of video games look appealing. Still, it’s important to remember that these positive effects of video games come with a catch: they can be far outweighed by the cons if gaming becomes an addiction.</p>

                        <b className="sub-blog-list">HOW TO QUIT A GAMING ADDICTION</b>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">If you or your teen is ready to address a gaming problem, the five steps below may help them learn how to quit a gaming addiction.
                            <ol>
                                <li className="sub-blog-list">SET A STRICT TIME LIMIT FOR DAILY PLAY
                                    <p className="sub-blog-list">Experts on children’s health agree that school-aged children should not spend more than two hours each day in front of any screen. Between television, cell phones, homework, and gaming, time can add up quickly. If you’re worried about how much time you or your child spends gaming, start by limiting play to no more than 30 minutes each day. Set the alarm or ask a friend to send you a text to remind you it’s time to do something else.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li className="sub-blog-list">REMOVE GAMING DEVICES FROM BEDROOM
                                    <p className="sub-blog-list">Having gaming devices in the bedroom makes it too easy to play whenever you feel like it. In addition, playing before bedtime can result in poor-quality sleep. Keeping the bedroom screen-free will help you control your gaming time and help ensure you feel rested and energized in the morning.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li className="sub-blog-list">ASK FRIENDS AND FAMILY FOR HELP
                                    <p className="sub-blog-list">Let your friends and family in your life know you’re concerned about developing a gaming addiction and are trying to cut back. If that seems too personal, just let people know you’re interested in doing more social activities. Set up a time to hang out with friends, go for hikes or bike rides, or attend school events.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li className="sub-blog-list">TRY OTHER STRESS-RELIEVING ACTIVITIES
                                    <p className="sub-blog-list">Gaming relieves stress for many people. Developing other coping strategies will make it easier to limit game time. Learn how to meditate or do yoga. Try working out or go for a challenging hike. Creative expression is also a stress-buster. Draw, paint, write, play music or enjoy any other screen-free hobby.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li className="sub-blog-list">SEEK GAMING ADDICTION TREATMENT
