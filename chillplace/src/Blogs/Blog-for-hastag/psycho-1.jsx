                            <li>Information chaos & choice crisis
                                <p>According to Forbes, every day approximately 2.5 quintillion (or 2.5 billion billion) bytes of information are created, and this number will increase even more with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). In the last 2 years alone, we have generated 90% of all information worldwide.</p>
                                <p>According to data from the Ministry of Information and Communications, Vietnam ranks 10th worldwide in terms of the percentage of population using the Internet with more than 60% of Vietnamese accessing the Internet every day.</p>
                                <p>In the midst of that information, we spend most of our time reading newspapers and participating in social networks. However, the human brain as an information processor and our ability to distill data is limited. This leads to a reality: the world presents young people with a banquet of information and options. Instead of choosing a direction for ourselves, we get overwhelmed. We can't make decisions without feeling like we're missing out on countless other opportunities.</p>
                                <p>In terms of work, young Vietnamese people face many crossroads. A young person graduating from college or university can start working and progress gradually. Or that young person can become a freelancer if there are skills. More commonly, she can do business.</p>
                                <p>Modern society teaches us that no matter what path we take, we should “succeed” and not squander our potential. However, Vietnamese young people at the present time may find themselves at a point where society does not have a universal "compass" to navigate the path to success.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>The wall between expectations and reality
                                <p>In the information crisis, there are two factors that make the way young people see the world misleading and sometimes inaccurate, that is fake news (fake news) and pseudoscience (pseudoscience).</p>
                                <p>Fake news is information that is inaccurate, misleading, or distorted. Pseudoscience, more dangerously, are flawed facts masquerading as science. We can find pseudoscience in many popular self-help books, and even in TED Talks with millions of views.</p>
                                <p>Information when guided by data and scientific research is often assumed to be true, even though sometimes such numbers and information are not conclusive by scientific standards. As a result, the stories we read about successful people are not only incomplete, but they can also convey an oversimplified message about how the world works. There are many young people who drop out of school with the reason, "Bill Gates also dropped out of school and still succeeded."</p>
                                <p>But, how to be successful when we have not yet decided what success, personally, means? Successful "fairies" swallow up young people's ability to self-concept about success, including young Vietnamese. We live among expectations of success that are not built on reality. In fact, we still don't know which direction we should go next.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>As soon as you go, you will come, but you have to go first
                                <p>If successful "fairies" should teach us anything, they shouldn't teach us that we must be successful. They should teach us that successful people are always at a point very far and very different from where they originally stood. Most of the time, that distance can't be planned in detail and with little precision.</p>
                                <p>Creative Director Dzung Yoko was a graphic designer long before he got into fashion. “If you're still “lost,” he says, “just get down to doing whatever you can. [...] After a period of collision with the profession, with life, you will realize what is the right career for you. "</p>
                                <p>In the crisis of choice, young people easily force themselves into thinking that the right choice leads to the "right" career; invisible medium cannot make a choice, for fear of choosing "wrong". Is that really the case? If fashion is Dzung Yoko's destined destination, is graphic design the wrong move? No, it was a step, his stepping stone to a higher destination. Because everything we do prepares us for the next step. In the process of working with the most dedication and persistence, we will understand more about the world, and above all, understand ourselves better.</p>
                                <p>Careers are sometimes about discovering things we know we don't know, achieving dreams we never dreamed of, or setting foot on destinations that were never planned.</p>
                                <p>So choose the right and most reasonable thing at the present time. Go before you know for sure that this move is "perfect" and the most correct. Amidst the flood of information and the "banquet" of choices, don't wait for another article or TED Talk to help you make the right decision.</p>
                                <p>Success is not determined by one long jump, but by many small but steady steps. Don't think that if you walk like Steve Jobs, you will become Steve Jobs. Walk your own steps, and you will be you.</p>
                                <p>The important thing is to go first.</p>
