                        <p className="sub-blog-list">First, it must be mentioned that the sensitive images and erotic actions make the adults themselves "hot" in the face. It appears on all social networking platforms that any child can surf without parental control.</p>

                        <p className="sub-blog-list">For a 12-year-old patient being treated at the National Children's Hospital, even when asked by doctors to encourage her, she constantly cried, agitated and got angry easily. The family said that in the past, children used a lot of time in the day to use social networks.

                        <p className="sub-blog-list">And at a psychological consultation room of the HOPE Center for Early Intervention and Psychotherapy, 80% of the patients coming here are children who tend to use social media more than 10 hours a day.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">Dr. Nguyen Thi Thu Hien - Clinical Psychologist, HOPE Center for Early Intervention and Psychotherapy shared: "Using social networks a lot will increase FOMO syndrome, which is the feeling of missing something. should check text messages constantly. There are children who use social media until 3-4 am. When it has become a habit, the current strict control causes huge problems such as death threats, destruction. if it's forbidden and parents feel overwhelmed, they can't handle these issues.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">Typically, a 14-year-old patient, who was a good student on the team, was seriously affected by his "addicted" to playing video games. My parents were also helpless many times. When there was a controlling move, she got mad, smashed and pushed her parents, refused to go to school, dropped out. When entering the main school year, she tends to take one day off a week.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">Also according to Dr. Do Minh Loan, in the past few years, the number of children brought to the hospital by their parents for examination and counseling due to psychological problems, the cause of which is related to the use of social networks tends to increasing, the treatment for children also faces more difficulties.</p>

Children are more likely to use violence when dealing with problems or conflicts with friends or family. Many of you live more loosely and even have promiscuous sexual activities. As social media becomes more accessible, the consequences it brings are more unpredictable.</p>

                        <p className="sub-blog-list">Many people think that children are a mirror of their parents. This is understandable because the daily actions, gestures and words of adults will greatly affect the development of children's intelligence, moral qualities, lifestyle, and way of thinking.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">In the 4.0 era, it is undeniable that technology helps children a lot in learning, entertaining and connecting with people. However, every parent, school and community needs to make an effort to help children become healthy digital citizens.</p>

                        <p className="sub-blog-list">From every home to school, electronic devices are gradually being minimized. Keeping the phone in the locker from the beginning of the hour until the end of the day to be taken out is the regulation of Luong The Vinh Middle & High School so that students can fully enjoy their study time and play time when they come to school.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">Do not swear on Facebook, do not like bad content, these taboos are popularized by the school with all students at the beginning of the school year. The rules boards attached in the hallway, crept into every class hour have partly changed the habits of children when using social networks.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">Obviously, educating a child is never easy, so it takes adults to spend more time and effort. Hopefully each child will grow up in a healthy real and virtual environment, they will build a scientific lifestyle to know that when they turn off their phones, the world out there has a lot to explore. break.</p>
