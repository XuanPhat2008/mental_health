                        <p className="sub-blog-list">It may sound counterintuitive, but this is a somewhat distorted truth within each of us. The more we are addicted to comfort, the more we like the feeling of pain and struggle. This happens because the process of overcoming pain makes us feel that we have lived a meaningful life.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">The most important and decisive moments in life are often also the most unpleasant: a near-death experience, the loss of a loved one, a divorce, a breakup, winning a fierce battle or passing a difficult time. stress challenge. It is through difficulties that we grow, and when we look back later, we will be grateful for what we went through.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">When I think of the most resilient people I've ever known, I'm struck not only by their acceptance of suffering in life, but by seeing it as part of their identity . They let themselves be shaped by their pain.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">Come to think of it, there was a time when I did the same thing, when I started my business in 2008. Back then I worked frantically 12, 14, even 16 hours a day. I still clearly remember there were nights when I fell asleep with the computer still on my stomach, only to wake up in the morning to sit up and type again.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">I worked so frantically at first purely out of fear. I was empty-handed back then and had nowhere to go. I had to stay at a friend's house, and later was supported by my girlfriend. Most of the time I couldn't even pay for my house and buy food, but I still "stubbornly" believed that, even if I failed, at least I tried my best and had no regrets.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">It felt bad, but over time it gradually became normal. It also made me realize that I have unknowingly "forged" a form of superpower for me ever since.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">A few years later, when I was with some friends in a co-working space by the sea, I realized that I was the first to turn on and the last to close the computer every day. I work through weekends and holidays without realizing it.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">The "workaholic" has become something I'm proud of, a part of my identity that I sometimes want to "flex". I am the one who works harder than anyone else, works tirelessly, and when I'm tired, the keyboard becomes a pillow.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">Of course, being too addicted to work also has its disadvantages. But now I've learned how to turn the "workaholic" mode on or off under the right circumstances. It was still there when I needed it, and I'm still proud of it. To be more precise, I still derive pleasure in a sinful way from it.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">To this day, there are times when I still feel strangely proud to spend an entire weekend working. No one knows or cares about it, as long as I like it. It is the pain that makes me happy.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">We all have some secret pain that makes us happy. With athletes, that's when they do the physical test. For scientists, they find joy in analyzing huge amounts of data. As for soldiers and policemen, they pride themselves on putting themselves in danger to protect others.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">What pain makes you secretly happy? And how can you use it to help yourself during difficult times?</p>

                        <p className="sub-blog-list">“Eggs don't put in one basket” is a primer for anyone who wants to learn how to invest. You don't want to spend all your money buying Apple stock, because if the company doesn't do well, your savings will be gone. Instead, you have to invest in a variety of channels. Assuming something goes wrong, you don't lose all your money at once.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">You can think of relationships in a similar way. We all have to invest in ourselves. If good things come, we will naturally feel happy; If something bad happens, we feel bad.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">But an important part of life is building relationships with other people. It's like you invest a small amount of your happiness in them, and get a share of their happiness in return. This way you can share your happiness with many people and different aspects of your life. This variety improves mental health, making it more resilient when your life is up and down.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">You need to build a strong network of relationships. So that when life throws you, you will have a safety net ready to prevent you from falling. They are the ones who can step in and share a bit of the emotional burden with you.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">You want to have friends who really listen, care, and drink with you all night, even if their drinking isn't that great. They will often call to check on you, even if you are drowning in your own self-pity.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">Because no matter how strong you think you are, no one can stand on their own forever. As human beings, we have evolved to be emotionally dependent on each other, relying on and needing each other, especially during the most difficult times.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">If you are currently suffering, the most valuable thing you can do is reach out and connect with someone, talk about your problem, share your pain with them. It is essential to help you deal with any kind of trauma.</p>
                        <p className="sub-blog-list">If your life is blooming, it's wonderful. But remember to take advantage of this time to cultivate more good relationships, share positivity, diversify your emotional investments, and build a solid support network. Because no fun lasts forever, and when the next event happens, you wouldn't want to suffer alone, would you?</p>
