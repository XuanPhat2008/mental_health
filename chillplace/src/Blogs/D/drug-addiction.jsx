                        <p className="drug-blog-list">However, with all drug addicts, there is a common manifestation of withdrawal syndrome, also known as drug shortage and hunger syndrome. This syndrome occurs when an addict stops using a drug that previously used a lot or used it for a long time but is no longer able to continue buying drugs. When at least three of the following symptoms are present (about eight to twelve hours after the last dose) withdrawal is diagnosed:
                            <ul>
