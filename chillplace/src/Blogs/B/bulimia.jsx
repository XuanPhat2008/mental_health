People may also experience:

                        <b className="bulimia-blog-list">Diagnoses</b>
                        <p className="bulimia-blog-list">Most of the symptoms and signs associated with bulimia nervosa are reversible with treatment. If you don't have a doctor who specializes in mental health, feel free to start with speaking with your primary care physician.</p>
                        <p className="bulimia-blog-list">A doctor or mental health professional will ask questions about physical health, mental health, behaviors, and medical history. A physical examination will also be performed and lab tests may be ordered to help rule out other conditions or diseases. Diagnosis can be complicated by the fact that many people with eating disorders hide their behaviors.</p>
                        <p>Bulimia nervosa is characterized by:
                            <ul>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Repeated episodes of binge eating, which is eating a large amount of food in a short period of time and feeling out of control while doing so</li>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">The use of compensatory behaviors such as vomiting, fasting, using laxatives or diuretics, or engaging in extreme amounts of exercise in order to offset eating.</li>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Self-evaluation is unjustifiably influenced by body shape and weight.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p className="bulimia-blog-list">Because many people who have bulimia are of average weight, physical symptoms of bulimia may not be noticeable to others until the disorder has become extremely severe. It is important for anyone experiencing associated symptoms to be assessed by a physician.</p>
                        <p className="bulimia-blog-list">In addition to these diagnostic criteria, the binging/purging must occur at least once a week for the last three months. and the behavior must not be caused by anorexia.</p>
                        <p className="bulimia-blog-list">If you or someone you know is showing signs of bulimia nervosa, please seek out or encourage your loved one to seek out professional help. Simply having a conversation about your behaviors toward food, eating, stress, and more can give your doctor valuable insight to help you.</p>
                        <p><i className="bulimia-blog-list">Bulimia vs. Other Eating Disorders</i></p>
                        <p>Sometimes, people with anorexia nervosa will also use binging or purging behaviors. However, the distinction between bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa is that people struggling with anorexia nervosa have significantly low body weight.4 Additionally, people who binge but do not purge may meet the criteria for binge eating disorder.</p>

                        <p>The exact causes of bulimia are not known, but there are a number of factors that may play a role:
                            <ul>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Biological factors</li>

                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Genetics</li>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Having family members with eating disorders</li>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Media influences and exposure to unhealthy role models</li>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Negative thought patterns</li>

                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p className="bulimia-blog-list">It is also not uncommon for people with bulimia to have co-occurring mental health conditions including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and substance use disorders.</p>

                        <b className="bulimia-blog-list">Treatment</b>
                        <p className="bulimia-blog-list">Treatment for bulimia focuses on changing binging-purging behaviors and replacing distorted thought patterns. A treatment plan will often involve psychotherapy, medications, and nutritional education. Because treatment addresses many different life areas, it often involves a treatment team that may include doctors, mental health professionals, and dietitians.</p>
                        <p><i className="bulimia-blog-list">Psychotherapy</i></p>
                        <p>Three forms of psychotherapy that are often helpful in the treatment of bulimia include:7
                            <ul>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): This type of therapy focuses on identifying and changing the negative underlying thoughts and attitudes about weight and shape. People learn to change these thoughts and adopt healthier behaviors. People also develop coping mechanisms and learn how to delay purging behaviors.</li>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Dialectical-behavior therapy (DBT): This approach incorporates CBT and focuses on improving relationships, practicing mindfulness, increasing distress tolerance, and learning emotional management skills.</li>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Family-based treatment (FBT): This approach is family-focused and initially involves parents or caregivers taking complete control of the individual's eating. Eventually, the individual is able to gradually regain control of meal planning and eating until they achieve healthy independence.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p><i className="bulimia-blog-list">Medications</i></p>
                        <p>Treatment for bulimia may also include the use of antidepressant medications including:
                            <ul>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Zoloft (sertraline), Prozac (fluoxetine), and Paxil (paroxetine)</li>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as Effexor (venlafaxine) and Cymbalta (duloxetine)</li>

                        <p>Getting appropriate treatment is essential, but there are also things you can do to take care of yourself during your recovery.
                            <ul>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Treat yourself kindly. Avoid criticizing yourself or expecting immediate results. It takes time to establish new ways of thinking and healthy habits.</li>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Stick to your plan. Even when you are tempted to stray from your therapy or eating plan, focus on sticking with it. It's normal to feel uncomfortable at times, so be sure to talk to your doctor or therapist about the difficulties you are dealing with.</li>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Use relaxation techniques. Find ways to cope with feelings of distress such as visualization, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation.</li>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Rely on your support system. Talk to the people you are closest to and discuss the kind of support you need. Reach out to these people during times when you need extra help or a safe space.</li>
                                <li className="bulimia-blog-list">Use positive self-talk. In addition to addressing negative thoughts and self-perceptions in therapy, work on using positive self-talk in your daily life. If you find yourself dwelling on negative thoughts, look for ways to reframe those thoughts in a more realistic, positive way.</li>
